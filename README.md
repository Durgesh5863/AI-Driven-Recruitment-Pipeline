# End-to-End AI-Driven Recruitment Pipeline
###  Real-Time Interview Insights and Cultural Fit Scoring



## Overview

This project implements an advanced AI-driven recruitment pipeline designed to revolutionize the hiring process. By integrating machine learning and data analysis techniques, the pipeline provides real-time interview insights and cultural fit scoring to ensure optimal hiring decisions.

The solution consists of five key stages:

1. **Data Generation:** Automates the creation of synthetic datasets tailored to recruitment scenarios.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes and visualizes the dataset to extract meaningful patterns and insights.

3. **Training:** Builds and trains machine learning models for candidate screening and scoring.

4. **Screening:** Applies trained models to identify suitable candidates and flag those who do not meet the criteria.

5. **Prediction:** Provides real-time predictions and scoring during interviews.
## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates realistic datasets for modeling and testing.

- **Comprehensive EDA:** Offers rich visualizations to uncover key data trends and relationships.

- **Model Training:** Employs cutting-edge algorithms for candidate evaluation.

- **Real-Time Insights:** Delivers actionable insights during interviews.

- **Cultural Fit Scoring:** Evaluates candidates beyond skills, focusing on alignment with company culture.

- **AI-Powered Screening**: Leverage advanced natural language processing and machine learning models to analyze resumes, transcripts, and other applicant data for job relevance and skill matching.

- **Predictive Analytics**: Implement various algorithms and classification models to predict candidate success and improve decision-making.

- **Role-Specific Analysis**: Tailored recommendations and insights for various roles, ensuring fairness and efficiency in the hiring process.
